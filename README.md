# Food Tracker Application

## Overview

The Food Tracker Application is a comprehensive Flutter-based app designed to help users track their daily food intake and stay healthy. It provides functionalities to log meals, calculate calorie intake, track activities, and estimate nutrient consumption. The app also integrates with external APIs for data enrichment and uses a powerful AI chatbot for user assistance.

Another feature is guaranteed privacy

## Privacy Standards üõ°Ô∏è

### üìÇ Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: All user data, including meal logs, activities, and personal information, is stored locally on the user's device using SQLite. This ensures that your data remains on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers.

### üîê Data Security

- **Data Backup**: Users can export data for backup purposes, but the exported data is not encrypted by the app. Users are responsible for securing exported data.

### üìà Anonymous Telemetry

- **Telemetry Data**: The app sends totally anonymous and really simple telemetry data to the server to help improve app performance and user experience. This data includes information such as app open timestamp and what page the user visit in the app.
